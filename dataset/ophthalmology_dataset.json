The remainder of his medical history was noncontributory.\nInspection of the right lower eyelid revealed a cystic-appearing nodule that transilluminated and had a few overlying telangiectasias. The cystic portion was continuous with a deeper, smooth subcutaneous component that was well defined, firm, and nonmobile, with a total lesion length of 1 cm (Figure 1A). There was no madarosis, eyelid margin effacement or preauricular lymphadenopathy. Although no overt features of malignancy were present, the deeper component was atypical for a hidrocystoma and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic evaluation showed a neoplasm composed of low-grade round nuclei growing in a micropapillary pattern within pools of extracellular mucin (Figure 1B). There was tumor present at the margin. Immunostains were positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Variable staining for INSM1, a sensitive nuclear stain for neuroendocrine differentiation, and focal staining for synaptophysin, another neuroendocrine marker, were also seen.

The lesion was not causing substantial discomfort, and the patient denied additional symptoms, including vision changes. The patient had no history of malignancy or other dermatologic problems. On examination, he had a large erythematous nodule with raised borders under the right brow with central ulceration that was draining clear material (Figure 1A). The rest of the ophthalmic examination was normal. Based on the rapid presentation and clinical appearance, the lesion was hypothesized to be a brow abscess. The patient was prescribed clindamycin 4 times a day for 10 days and erythromycin ointment twice a day for 10 days, instructed to start warm compresses to promote abscess drainage and healing, and told to follow up in 1 week. Erythromycin, commonly used in skin infections, was used topically for coverage of gram-positive and some gram-negative organisms. Clindamycin was prescribed orally due to the concern for skin abscess and to cover Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species.\nAfter 1 week, the lesion continued to enlarge (Figure 1B). The ulcerated central depression displayed minimal drainage without expressible material. The patient’s ophthalmic examination continued to be otherwise normal. Although trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin cover various Staphylococcus subtypes, the patient was prescribed trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 14 days given no response to the clindamycin trial and to increase the gram-negative coverage.

Fluorescein angiography demonstrated retinal vascular leakage in the macula with fluorescein accumulation in a petaloid pattern surrounding the fovea There was some consideration that the CME was associated with ellipsoid-zone or retinal pigment epithelial disruption associated with his hereditary chorioretinopathy, but there was no evidence of ellipsoid-zone–retinal pigment epithelial disruption . Medical history included type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and HIV infection. Medications included darunavir, ritonavir, furosemide, insulin, and apixaban. There was no change in CME after 3 months of topical ketorolac, 0.5%, dministered 6 times daily and topical prednisolone acetate, 1%, administered 4 times daily.

She had previously been diagnosed with VKC associated with AD at 9 years old and for 4 years was treated with eye drops containing tacrolimus, cyclosporine, steroids, and antiallergic agents. Despite topical treatment with eye drops, the giant papillae on the tarsal conjunctiva continued to worsen and resolve seasonally. Corneal lesions such as a shield ulcer and superficial punctate keratitis in her right eye persisted for 3 months. AD was observed on her skin, including the face, and was treated with tacrolimus ointments, steroid ointments, and a moisturizer. As the patient’s AD was severe with persistent skin rash refractory to treatment with topical medications, oral upadacitinib (15 mg/d) was administered for AD. Scores for the Eczema Area and Severity Index and the Investigator’s Global Assessment before and 2 weeks after upadacitinib treatment improved from 28.0 to 1.2 and 3 to 2, respectively. The pain and itching in the right eye improved within a month after upadacitinib administration. Additionally, the giant papillae gradually flattened, and corneal lesions improved after upadacitinib administration. After 3 months of oral upadacitinib administration, the giant papillae and punctate epithelial keratitis resolved completely , and vision improved to 20/16 OD.
